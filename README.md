**Hardware Neural Network Accelerator for XOR Logic Implementation using Verilog**

---

**Short Description:**  
This project designs and implements a fully functional neural network in hardware using Verilog HDL to solve the classic 3-input XOR problem. The implementation features a multi-layer perceptron architecture with sigmoid activation functions, fixed-point arithmetic precision, and synchronous digital design principles. The neural network demonstrates the capability of hardware-based machine learning systems to perform complex non-linear computations with low latency and high efficiency.

**Key Features:**
- **Neural Network Architecture**: 3-4-1 layer structure (3 inputs, 4 hidden neurons, 1 output)
- **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Q8.8 format for efficient hardware implementation
- **Activation Function**: Hardware-optimized sigmoid approximation
- **Synchronous Design**: Clock-driven operation with reset functionality
- **Complete Testbench**: Automated testing of all 8 input combinations with PASS/FAIL verification
- **Waveform Generation**: VCD output for detailed timing analysis

This project serves as a fundamental building block for more complex hardware neural networks and demonstrates the practical implementation of machine learning algorithms in digital hardware.
